Howdy, and welcome to my GitHub! 

My name is Justin Thompson and I am a Junior at Texas A&M University studying computer science. I'm working on several different projects right now, but most of them are private.

One of my most active projects is a Mexican Train scorekeeping app for iOS that uses image processing to scan and detect how many pips are on a set of dominoes.

I am open to new opportunities including internships, part-time jobs, and projects.
